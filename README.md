# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe  

Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun two-player strategy game played on a **3x3 grid**. One player uses **“X”** and the other uses **“O”**. The goal is to place **three identical marks** in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before your opponent does. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a **draw**.
